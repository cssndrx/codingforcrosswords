											<h2>Have you wanted to learn to code?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
                    This is your chance! In about 30 total hours, including
                    12 hours of video instruction plus exercises, we walk
                    with you from the absolute basics of adding one plus one
                    to writing a small complete application that constructs
                    personalized crossword puzzles
                    that you can give to your family and friends.
                    </p>
										<p>
                    The world of computer programming can open up many doors.
                    But you won't retain the knowledge unless it's enjoyable to
                    learn.  Each of 19 modules in
							      <a href="#thebasics">The Basics</a>
                    section focuses on a particular goal, such as
                    reading a crossword grid from a file or finding word
                    matches, and we introduce only those language concepts
                    necessary to accomplish that goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Take it at your speed!
                    In each module there are three or four challenges where
                    you will stop the video and code on your own.
                    You will make mistakes! There will be some unexpected
                    errors, and there will even be some struggles!
                    But this is where the learning happens and after you get
                    things to work it will ignite your sense of wonder about
                    the power of computers and you will be proud of your
                    mastery of this subject.
                    You will realize (shh, it's our secret!) that coding isn't
                    so hard after all!

									<h2>System Requirements</h2>
									<p>
                  This class teaches the C++ programming language.
                  When learning to program, you have many good choices of
                  general-purpose programming languages including 
                  <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>,
                  Java, Javascript, Go, C#, Ruby, and Rust,
                  to name a few. 

                  See <a href="#thebasics">Module 0</a> for more discussion
                  about these choices.

                  "R" and SQL are two examples of
                  special-purpose languages not included in this list;
                  you are best to seek specialized instruction if
                  statistical computing or relational database programming is
                  your goal.

									</p>
									<p>
                  Otherwise, for basic functionality such as the data
                  structures and simple algorithms that we teach in this course,
                  all of these languages are more similar to each other than
                  they are different.
                  A good course of action is to find a course with subject
                  matter that you enjoy as the most important priority,
                  for instance this course teaches how to construct
                  crossword puzzles,
                  learn the language that that course teaches,
                  and then it is straightforward to learn the syntax of any
                  other language later as needed for your particular situation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  To perform the exercises you will need a compute environment
                  that has an installed and working
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">
                  GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
                  </a>
                  G++ compiler
                  that converts C++ source code into an
                  executable that will run on your system.
                  G++ is a standard tool worldwide but in most systems it
                  does not come enabled by default, so you will need to
                  perform some installation and configuration steps.
                  Most other C++ compilers should also work
                  with no changes to the source code if you happen to
                  have another one besides G++ available to you.
                  You will also need an editor and/or an Integrated
                  Development Environment (IDE) that lets you write the
                  source code files.
									</p>
									<p>
							    Module 2 discusses how to create your environment for
                  these different platforms:
									</p>
									<ul class="actions special">
										<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Rov1Hm14ZoY" class="button primary">Windows (2A)</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://youtu.be/tAM9Qw9eb3g" class="button primary">Browser (2B)</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Tail1GnGoBk" class="button primary">Linux (2C)</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://youtu.be/dZhrX9Rxd-o" class="button primary">Mac (2D)</a></li>
									</ul>

									<p>
                  "Browser" means there are websites that
                  let you enter, save, compile, and run C++ by using only
                  a browser. Some activity like reading from files or
                  running a large amount of compute (for big crosswords) can be
                  limited in these environments, but they let you get started
                  easily.
									</p>
									<p>
                  All video content is delivered on 
								  <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>.
                  At multiple points per module, you will be asked to pause the
                  video and type in code yourself.
                  You only learn programming by doing, so get ready to 
                  roll up your sleeves!

							<h2>About this project</h2>
							<p>
              My name is Glen Anderson and I've programmed for 30 years
              at different companies in Silicon Valley including
              most recently Google's machine learning team.

              During the Covid quarantine, I wrote some crossword construction
              software for fun, and I realized that this task of
              finding words to match intersecting patterns used a good variety
              of basic computer programming techniques and could be the
              demonstration vehicle to spread the joy of computer programming.
              Thus, the concept for this course was born!
              I hope it succeeds in bringing you joy as well.
